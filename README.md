# Final-Project-Game

Browser game combining HTML/CSS/JS

Bringing back the classic chutes and ladders:

Skeleton: A board (grid of 100 spaces), scoreboard(? player position determines winner)

Look: eh...

logic:
number randomizer for die rolls 1-6
async/await - die roll result is the next move
climb/jump ahead spaces, fall back spaces ()
