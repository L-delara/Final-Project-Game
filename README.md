Final Project #1 for NCSU Web Development Bootcamp
Browser game combining basics of HTML/CSS/JS

Description, history, application purpose....

This game is great for passing time without much stress or thought. This application can also be used to decide who wins to start a different game or
simple turn-based role-playing games.

Javascript logic needed:
-- number randomizer for die rolls 1-6
-- after each die is rolled, display shows who won, lost, or tied
-- terminates game and round based on conditions met
   -- first player to 3 wins wins the round, game asks for a rematch.

This is a simple project with no back-end or full stack. It is presently hosted on Netlify (last checked 9/10):

Bugs, notes, next steps, etc:
This was originally intended as a game of snakes and ladders. 
This required far more steps than was feasible for the initial timeframe and as such is a partial but functional component to be used with other applications.

In the future, some features to possibly add:
- would like to disable roller buttons once game is won by a player.
- would like to restore avatar to selector box if a player changes their mind. Picking an avatar doesn't do anything, it's just nice.
- Would like to figure out how to put winner name or avatar in the winner box at the end of the game.
