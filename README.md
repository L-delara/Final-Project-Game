Final-Project-Game
Browser game combining HTML/CSS/JS

logic:
-- number randomizer for die rolls 1-6
-- shows who won vs who lost
-- terminates game and round based on conditions met

Next:
Made life too hard with snakes and ladders. switched to something more doable in this time frame.

- would like to disable roller buttons once game is won by a player.
- would like to restore avatar to selector box if a player changes their mind. Doesn't do anything to pick an avatar, it's just nice.
- Would like to figure out how to put winner name or avatar in the winner box at the end of the game.
- would like to go back to snakes and ladders to create a series of games to pick from.
- want to try a Hungry, Hungry Hippo situation...
